# Git Practial

Introducing the fundamentals of git using the command line

## Objectives

### Why use a version control system (such as Git)?

* You can keep track of the changes you make to your project as you
  work on it (like 'save points' in a computer game, you can go back
  to previous states)

* If you're working on the same project as other people, it helps you
  handle the synchronization (friction?) points when you make changes

### Why use Git specifically?

* It's the most popular (the default?), and it strikes a good balance
  between being easy to use, and being powerful

* It's decentralized, so you can do everything offline, and don't need
  to configure any server

* It makes it easy to try new things locally without having to worry
  about breaking everything, or losing stuff
